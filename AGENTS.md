# Agent Instructions

## Overview
This file defines global rules. Detailed skills live in `/skills`.

## Global Rules
- Follow existing code style
- Do not introduce breaking changes
- All code that is not specific to the App must be in separate packages in the `packages/` folder
- In the `apps/` folder, there live apps with only specific code for that app (UI, business logic, etc.)
